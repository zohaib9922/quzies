 == Why use Opinion Stage? ==

 * Boost engagement & traffic - add a poll, survey or quiz to your posts/pages to increases participation, time-on-site & page views. Increase social sharing and viral distribution.
 * Gather more qualified leads - integrate a lead form inside the poll, quiz or survey.
 * Drive sales/revenue - take advantage of the high engagement rates to increase revenue from ads inside and outside of the polls and quizzes.
 * Extract insights - get more insights using interactive polls & surveys designed to maximize participation. Extract actionable insights with an intuitive analytics dashboard.

 == Best Practices for creating an effective quiz ==

 * Start by setting the objective – before starting to plan the quiz, determine what you want to achieve. Are you looking to generate engagement, to gather leads, to drive social sharing, or do you have a different motivation? For example, if you are looking to generate leads, it is usually better to keep it shorter. If you are looking to generate engagement you will prefer to make it longer. If you are looking to get social shares, your focus should be on designing an outcome that will get shared.

 * Select a topic based on your audience – in the planning phase, keep your audience in mind. What topic will they find interesting or appealing? A quiz that works great for one audience, might not perform as well for another audience.
Select a great title – the title is the single most important part of a quiz. Select a title that appeals to your audience, makes them interested or curious to discover something about themselves or about others. Try to keep the title clear and short as possible. Add humor when relevant.

 * Keep it short, but not too short – If the quiz is too short, users tend to regard it as not serious enough or as content that will not bring much value. However, if it is too long, users will get tired and drop-off. At some point, adding another question will get you fewer responses. We recommend including 5-15 questions depending on the context.

 * Make it visual – Opinion Stage lets you add images and videos in the quiz. You can add an image to the cover, and an intro image to each question. You can also add an image to each answer. Visuals will both get you more responses and will also improve the context of the questions and answers.

 * Get shared in social networks – start by creating outcomes that are shareable. Examples can include sharing your results in a trivia quiz or sharing the personality you got in a personality test. It is recommended to keep the outcome
text as positive as possible regardless of the results.
Place in a prominent location – to verify your item is noticed, place it in a central place in your site. A few options we recommend – above the fold in posts/pages, in the sidebar, enter/exit popup, or in a quiz section in your site.

 * Brand and customize – Opinion Stage lets you change every aspect of the visual. Customize the quiz so it matches your site and brand. You can set the font, sizes, and colors of the quiz. If you have some CSS knowledge you can customize almost every aspect of the quiz using the CSS override feature.

 * Track and optimize – Opinion Stage lets you track every aspect of the performance, including how many users viewed, started, and completed the quiz. Track these parameters and use the drop-off report to optimize the length and to find questions that need to be replaced or improved. For more advanced usage scenarios you can also a/b test.
